Hi, this is a brief guide to install the environment for using the file FinalProject.py

Open the terminal on linux machine and write: 
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt install python3-pip
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

After this you are ready to start the model

In the directory 'imgs/' you can save all the user profile pictures with the number ID as the name of the picture, to use it as a reference picture for that specific user.

In order to test the model I used my webcam, in FinalProject.py, line 6, '0' means the ID of my webcam device.
You should use the datastream from your app, so that in line 25, the while loop, iterate on the video from the user webcam.

To check the verification and liveness I just output 'Verified' and 'Fake' on the stdout stream of terminal, you can send any signal in every way possible.

Every directory name in every file is a relative path, so you can put the project in every directory you wish without worrying about renaming anything.

To call the model you'll need to write on the terminal:
    python3 "path_to_the_reference_picture" "path_to_the_video"
